# ClothingShopApp
### Clothing Shop App

**Concepts:** Application Development, Object-Oriented Programming Principles, System Process Management

**Software & Languages:** Java, Eclipse

**Packages:** N/A

**Description:** This report was a group project I worked on in a business programming course at UGA. We were tasked with creating an inventory database and system for a hypothetical online shopping system of our choosing. We decided to create a system for an online clothing store called "Custom Clothing Athens." We included scenario flowcharts, demonstrations, and UML diagrams. It covers the data types: Arrays, ArrayLists, HashSets, and HashMaps. The project also covers the object-oriented programming principles Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism. Since this project focused more on the server side and not the user interface, I have included the code and my group's presentation report which will help the viewer visualize the project.
